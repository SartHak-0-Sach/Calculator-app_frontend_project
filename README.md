## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build a basic calculator app that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Calculator-app_frontend_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project even though seems very simple has been a rollercoaster in itself and has taught me a lot of using javaScript to handle buttons and operate on them as shown-
```
function handleClick(event) {
  const buttonValue = event.target.innerText;

  // Check the type of button clicked and perform the corresponding action
  if (buttonValue === "DEL") {
    // Handle delete button
    currentExpression = currentExpression.slice(0, -1);
  } else if (buttonValue === "RESET") {
    // Handle reset button
    currentExpression = "";
  } else if (buttonValue === "=") {
    // Handle equal button
    try {
      const result = eval(currentExpression);
      output.innerText = formatNumberWithCommas(result);
      currentExpression = result.toString(); // Store the result as the new current expression
    } catch (error) {
      output.innerText = "Error";
      currentExpression = ""; // Clear the current expression in case of an error
    }
  } else {
    // Handle normal buttons
    currentExpression += buttonValue;
  }

  // Update the screen output with formatted number
  output.innerText = formatNumberWithCommas(currentExpression);
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources

- [Harkirat Singh course notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/harkirat-singh-course_code_and_notes) - I have added notes of all lectures along with code and lecture insights of all weeks along with bonus lectures to help you all as much as I can.
- [My development code and notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/cwh-web-dev-playlist_code_and_notes) - These are my notes that I made while working on my development skills in initial days and did these courses. Make sure to star the repository if you like it.‚ú®üí´
- [mdn documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand promises, async and await syntax. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
